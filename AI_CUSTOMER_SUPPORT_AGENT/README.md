🤖 AI Customer Support Agent

An LLM-powered intelligent customer support assistant built with Python and integrated with advanced NLP models for query understanding, solution generation, and automated responses.
This project demonstrates how AI can understand customer issues, retrieve relevant knowledge, and respond empathetically in real-time.

⸻

🚀 Project Overview

This application creates an AI-powered customer support pipeline to manage requests end-to-end:
	1.	Understands customer queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
	2.	Searches & retrieves solutions from an internal knowledge base or FAQs
	3.	Generates clear, polite, and context-aware responses

The AI acts as a single intelligent agent that combines classification, reasoning, and conversational abilities for customer support automation.
